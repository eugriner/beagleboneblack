# Como configurar a Beaglebone Black e tweaks para desenvolvimento rÃ¡pido

## Install new system http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardDebian
### Download
```
wget https://rcn-ee.com/rootfs/2016-03-11/elinux/debian-8.3-console-armhf-2016-03-11.tar.xz

## First connect
You can connect with ssh via ethernet:

```

or usb (https://learn.adafruit.com/ssh-to-beaglebone-black-over-usb/overview):
* Installing Drivers (Linux)
```
wget http://beagleboard.org/static/Drivers/Linux/FTDI/mkudevrule.sh
sudo ./mkudevrule.sh
```
This script will create a new file called 73-beaglebone.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/You will probably need to run the script as superuser."

ssh debian@name.local
ssh-keygen -t dsa
